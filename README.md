## Summary of Learnings

Through this assignment, I gained a practical understanding of Jenkins navigation and pipeline fundamentals:
* I learned to navigate the Jenkins dashboard to view jobs, the build queue, and build executor status. [cite: 6]
* I successfully created a pipeline job named "HelloJenkins" and defined several stages within it, including Build, Test, Deploy, and later a Cleanup stage. [cite: 7]
* After running the pipeline, I utilized the Stage View to visually track the progress and success of each stage. [cite: 8]
* I also became familiar with accessing and interpreting the Console Output to check detailed logs and messages generated during the build process for each stage. [cite: 9]
* This entire exercise helped solidify my understanding of how to effectively navigate Jenkins, manage and execute jobs, and monitor their outcomes. [cite: 10]
